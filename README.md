## Business Understanding
### Background
Marketing campaigns are sets of strategic and organized acts used by many companies to promote a 
specific company goal, i.e. promoting their new products. By using various approaches and ca 
combination of media, they then can locate their potential customers, and build a marketing strategy 
for future prospects.

### Problems
Based on the data of BukaToko marketing campaign on February 2019, we want 
to give **recommendations** and **build** a good **digital marketing strategy** for BukaToko’ next month marketing campaign

### Analytical Approaches
1. To find the best campaign in January 2019.
2. To find the best campaign objective, channel, OS, and conversion event.
3. To find the types of error that mostly happen to user.
4. To find campaign(s) which are not as successful as the test campaign.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is **credential**.

## Result
### Summary
1. **Metrics used**: Conversion uplift (%), to determine the impact of a campaign
2. **Best campaign objective**: Promo, Education, and Announcement
3. **Best campaign channel**: Push notification
4. **Best campaign OS**: iOS/Android (Though Android has higher uninstall rate)
5. **Unsuccessful campaign**: There are 11, e.g. Bitcoin Reminder (negative 
conversion uplift), ‘21 Juta Bitcoin di Dunia’, ‘Usability Testing Invitation’, etc.

### Recommendation
1. Use **‘Push Notification’** as the campaign’ **channels**. 
2. **‘Promo’**, **‘Education’**, or **‘Announcement’** campaign(s) are **more likely** to **success** (have a good user 
conversion rate).
3. Marketing **team(s)** in charge of **‘Email’** campaign(s) must **re-research** the right **potential target users**
and **CTA/contents** used in the email to decrease errors (including email dropped).
4. Further **evaluation** on **“buy_success”** conversion event Campaigns are **recommended** (many errors).
5. Further **inspection** (and maybe innovation) on **Android app’ push notification** feature are needed, 
as the number of uninstalled users are incomparably higher compared to iOS
